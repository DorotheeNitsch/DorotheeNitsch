## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am an electrical engineer working in energy system modeling, simulation, and data analysis. My work focuses on power systems, using a combination of programming, simulation software, and specialized tools.

## Languages
- Python
- MATLAB
- C

## Software
- MATLAB/Simulink
- PowerFactory
- Integral

## Tools & Libraries
- **OpenStreetMap (johnyf/openstreetmap)**: Used in my Master's thesis to extract OSM data and create synthetic low-voltage networks for selected map areas, making them load-flow capable.
- **MATPOWER (MATPOWER/matpower)**: Utilized in various projects for automated load-flow calculations of power grids.
<!-- - **PowerFactory Tools (ieeh-tu-dresden/powerfactory-tools)**: Employed for automated RMS simulations in energy system studies. -->
